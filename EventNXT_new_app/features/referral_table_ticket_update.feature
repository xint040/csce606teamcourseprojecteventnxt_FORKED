#Feature: Update the referral table by updating the tickets bought from the referee
#
#Scenario:
#          Given login
#          Given we have an event
#          Given we have seats
#          Given we have guests
#          Given we have a referral
#          Given we have a ticket information now from the box office sale information directly
#          Then similarly the referral table tickets values will be directly equal to the values on the ticket information
